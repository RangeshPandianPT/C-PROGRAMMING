## 📚 Topics Covered

The files are organized according to concepts, including but not limited to:

* **Basics of C**

  * Input/Output
  * Data Types & Variables
  * Operators & Expressions

* **Control Structures**

  * If-Else Statements
  * Switch Case
  * Loops (for, while, do-while)

* **Functions**

  * User-defined functions
  * Recursion

* **Arrays & Strings**

  * 1D & 2D Arrays
  * String handling

* **Pointers**

  * Basics of pointers
  * Pointer arithmetic
  * Pointers with arrays and functions

* **Structures & Unions**

* **File Handling**

  * Reading/Writing files

* **Data Structures (Intro)**

  * Linked Lists
  * Stacks & Queues (basic)

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have **GCC** or any C compiler installed.

```bash
# Compile
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run
./output
```

For Windows (MinGW):

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output.exe
output.exe
```
